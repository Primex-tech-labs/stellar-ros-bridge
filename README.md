# Stellar ROS Bridge

> A Rust framework that connects [ROS 2](https://ros.org) robots to the
> [Stellar](https://stellar.org) network, letting machines advertise
> capabilities, accept paid tasks, and settle rewards on-chain via
> [Soroban](https://stellar.org/soroban) smart contracts.

## Why this exists

Robots and autonomous fleets increasingly need to transact: rent out idle
capacity, pay for compute, settle for a delivered task, or coordinate across
organizations that do not trust one another. Today that coordination is glued
together with bespoke APIs, spreadsheets, and trust.

Stellar ROS Bridge closes that gap:

- **ROS 2** is where the robot's capabilities, sensors, and actions already live.
- **Stellar + Soroban** provide fast, low-cost, programmable settlement with a
  mature wallet and asset ecosystem.

This project is the missing seam between the two: a typed, testable, Rust-native
bridge that turns a robot's ROS 2 graph into a set of tradable on-chain services.

## Core ideas

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Capability** | A robot's advertised service (e.g. `navigate`, `pick`, `inspect`) published on a ROS 2 topic. |
| **Task** | A unit of paid work matching a Capability, with parameters, reward, and deadline. |
| **Escrow** | A Soroban contract that holds the reward until the task is proven complete. |
| **Proof** | Evidence a task finished (signed telemetry digest, sensor attestation, or maintainer sign-off). |
| **Settlement** | On-chain release of escrowed funds to the robot's Stellar account. |

## Repository layout

```
crates/
  bridge-core/      # Domain types, traits, error model (no I/O)
  ros-bridge/       # ROS 2 integration via rclrs
  stellar-bridge/   # Soroban/Stellar RPC client + escrow bindings
  bridge-node/      # Binary that wires the crates together
docs/               # Architecture, roadmap, contributor guides
.wave/              # Drips Wave issue backlog and process notes
```

## Status

**Bootstrapping.** The workspace compiles and the domain model is being
defined. There is no end-to-end robot-to-chain flow yet. See the
[roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) and the open
[Stellar Wave issues](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Stellar+Wave%22).

## Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Rust (see `rust-toolchain.toml` — installed automatically by rustup)
- ROS 2 (Jazzy or newer) sourced in your environment, for the `ros-bridge` crate
- A Stellar testnet account and funded key for integration work (see
  `docs/architecture.md#local-development`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Primex-tech-labs/stellar-ros-bridge
cd stellar-ros-bridge
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
```
